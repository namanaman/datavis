During the Egypt Economic Development Conference, March 13-15, 2015, the GOE mentioned the importance of having an inclusive economy, one that benefits the poor and the geographically isolated population. This activity does that by targeting poor communities in Upper Egypt in order to move them out of poverty.FAS will use a market-driven approach to increase agriculture related incomes of smallholder farmers in Upper Egypt through sustainable horticulture value chain systems strengthening for domestic and export (Global GAP and FAIRTRADE) markets. Interventions will include the introduction of farmers into new horticulture value chains, the establishment of forward contracts between farmers and buyers, on-farm water efficiency interventions and reduction in the gender gaps that were identified in the Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index. The results of the first two years will serve as a judging criteria to judge if interventions should be stopped, altered or scaled up.Results:-Increasing the incomes of 6,000 smallholder farmers. -Increase beneficiary agriculture productivity by 30%. -Measurable/significant increase in women's empowerment.-Increase on-farm water efficiency to 65%. -Improved micro-policy enabling environment in terms of sexual harassment policies adopted by agribusinesses.",29,Agriculture,76
