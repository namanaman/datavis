AVH currently has an on-going contract with the MoH to provide care and treatment for cancer patients. With prior year funding, the hospital is procuring the equipment needed to establish a bone marrow transplantation unit at AVH.Bone marrow transplantation services are not available within the Palestinian health system partially due to a lack of health professionals, especially nurses and allied health staff.

St. John's project under this grant aims at improving eye health care in isolated areas of the West Bank by supporting a mobile outreach clinic that visits vulnerable localities to provide people with eye care services and performing corrective eye surgeries at their East Jerusalem Hospital to prevent blindness from cataracts. The project will also increase the capacity of the hospital group through the installation of an electronic Health Information System (HIS). The mobile outreach van is fully equipped with medical specialized equipment for screening patients suffering from a variety of eye diseases. The mobile clinic will examine and screen patients for eye diseases, provide primary eye care services and medications, and refer patients with complicated eye problems to one of Saint John's hospitals or clinics. Patients who suffer from cataracts will be referred to undergo corrective surgery. This project anticipates providing eye services to 27,000 to 30,000 marginalized Palestinians, performing 1,500 corrective surgeries, and installing a HIS for all four St. John's facilities during the total life of the award. These results will strengthen the delivery of health care services to the most vulnerable populations in the West Bank.With new incremental funding, this project will continue to provide eye care services through the mobile outreach clinic vulnerable localities in the West Bank, perform corrective eye surgery, and complete the final phase in HIS implementation.",15,Other Public Health Threats,76

St. John's project under this grant aims at improving eye health care in isolated areas of the West Bank by supporting a mobile outreach clinic that visits vulnerable localities to provide people with eye care services and performing corrective eye surgeries at their East Jerusalem Hospital to prevent blindness from cataracts. The project will also increase the capacity of the hospital group through the installation of an electronic Health Information System (HIS). The mobile outreach van is fully equipped with medical specialized equipment for screening patients suffering from a variety of eye diseases. The mobile clinic will examine and screen patients for eye diseases, provide primary eye care services and medications, and refer patients with complicated eye problems to one of Saint John's hospitals or clinics. Patients who suffer from cataracts will be referred to undergo corrective surgery. This project anticipates providing eye services to 27,000 to 30,000 marginalized Palestinians, performing 1,500 corrective surgeries, and installing a HIS for all four St. John's facilities during the total life of the award. These results will strengthen the delivery of health care services to the most vulnerable populations in the West Bank.With new incremental funding, this project will continue to provide eye care services through the mobile outreach clinic vulnerable localities in the West Bank, perform corrective eye surgery, and complete the final phase in HIS implementation.",15,Other Public Health Threats,76

This project anticipates providing eye services to 27,000 to 30,000 marginalized Palestinians, performing 1,500 corrective surgeries, and installing a HIS for all four St. John's facilities during the total life of the award.

AVH currently has an on-going contract with the MoH to provide care and treatment for cancer patients. With prior year funding, the hospital is procuring the equipment needed to establish a bone marrow transplantation unit at AVH.Bone marrow transplantation services are not available within the Palestinian health system partially due to a lack of health professionals, especially nurses and allied health staff.

Development economists suggest that investment in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure is necessary for a country to achieve economic growth despite post-disaster and post-conflict situations. From a development perspective, this type of investment provides the following benefits: (1) it raises productivity; 2) there is a tendency toward increasing incomes; and 3) generally there are rising rates of returns on assets. Under this Assistance and Evaluation (A&E) IQC, USAID is funding a variety of activities, such as planning, design, development, construction and the assessment and evaluation associated with infrastructure projects throughout Africa, Asia, Europe and Eurasia, and Latin America. Over the last decade, USAID has been heavily involved in relief and reconstruction activities after several large scale disaster situations in Haiti, Pakistan, and Eastern Asia. Furthermore, much of USAID's development work has been devoted to reconstruction and stabilization in conflict and post-conflict countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan and Iraq. Because of the challenges of building, operating and maintaining infrastructure, working in post-conflict or post-disaster areas continues to requires intensive technical planning and design efforts.",41,Direct Administrative Costs,76
