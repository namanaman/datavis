MCC Funding for the As-Samra Expansion Project will support a portion of the cost associated with the construction of the expansion of the existing As-Samra Wastewater Treatment Plant. MCC Funding will also support technical assistance for the management and supervision of the construction. The expansion is designed to increase the hydraulic capacity of the existing treatment plant and its ability to handle suspended solids and biological materials, among other critical treatment requirements. The expanded plant will use activated-sludge technology with several important characteristics: (1) primary settling, (2) biological treatment and clarification, (3) disinfection by chlorination, (4) energy recovery from treated water, (5) primary and biological sludge thickening, (6) sludge digestion and biogas energy recovery, (7) digested sludge storage, (8) ventilation and odor control, and (9) a mechanical dewatering process that is designed to accelerate decomposition and reduce volumes of sludge. Under the As-Samra Expansion Project, the plant operator will develop a detailed Environmental and Social Impact Assessment that will build upon the 2003 Environmental Assessment for construction of the existing plant.

Public outreach activities will be conducted through TCCC's existing partners and will focus on consumer awareness related to metering, illegal connections, and demand management. Programming will also highlight benefits arising from community participation in water management. Expected results will be increased customer satisfaction due to improved service delivery, improved understanding of costs associated with water service delivery, and a higher acceptance of metering and a concomitant increase in bills paid.",36,Clean Productive Environment,76

In this regard, ABA ROLI has secured the commitment of Jordans new Minister of Justice, as head of Jordans Anti-Human Trafficking National Committee, to support this project (see Sect. 9 of this proposal). ABA ROLI will work with these institutions to conduct an analysis of past TIP court cases in order to identify how the adjudication process can be strengthened. This analysis will inform training workshops for judges and prosecutors and the development of recommendations to strengthen Jordans TIP law. ABA ROLI will also expand the cadre of experts developed under its previous TIP program.  ABA ROLI will also work with the Ministry of Justice, National Center for Human Rights, and local NGOs to achieve the second project objective of increased awareness and protection of legal rights of potential TIP victims.  This project objective will be achieved by broadening NGO capacity to identify trafficking crimes and their victims. ABA ROLI will support local NGOs in reaching migrant workers and advising them of their rights and how to access legal assistance. To support the workers, ABA ROLI will also train lawyers to provide legal aid to trafficking victims. In addition, ABA ROLI awareness-raising activities will target communities where there are increasing numbers of vulnerable Syrian refugees.",5,Transnational Crime,54
